Requirements
------------

### Apache 2

If you're on Mac OS X you can use MAMP for this if you like. However you set it up, you'll need to be able to edit your
virtual host configuration.

### PHP >= 5.3.7

With the following extensions:

- MCrypt
- PDO with MySQL support
- mbstring

You can use MAMP for this if you like; if you do, set up your PATH so you can use php and mysql tools on the command
line:

    echo -e '\nexport PATH=/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.4.4/bin:/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin:$PATH\n\n' >> ~/.profile

### MySQL

As above, you can use MAMP for this if you like.

Installing phpMyAdmin will be helpful if you don't have any other mysql tools installed.

### Ruby

The version of Ruby that comes preinstalled on Mac OS X is fine; if you don't have Ruby 1.8 installed
then follow the instructions at [http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

### NodeJS

Follow NodeJS install instructions at [http://nodejs.org/download/](http://nodejs.org/download/).

Then install the build system's requirements like so:

```bash
sudo easy_install Pygments &&
    sudo npm install -g grunt-cli mocha testem livereload docco &&
    sudo gem install compass
```

Note that that also installed the Ruby module `compass`.

### Composer

Follow the instructions at [http://getcomposer.org/](http://getcomposer.org/).

Setting up your development environment
---------------------------------------

Once you have the above requirements installed, you can set up your development server.

### Bootstrap your build environment

If you're on a unix-like environment, you can run:

```bash
./init.sh
```

Otherwise you'll need to do it manually:

```bash
cd build/
npm install
composer install
```

### Run a front-end production build

```
grunt
```

### Apache

Edit your /etc/hosts file (something like C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts on Windows):

```
127.0.0.1       {%= name %}.dev
```

Then add a virtual host to your Apache configuration:

```
<VirtualHost *>
    DocumentRoot "/path/to/{%= name %}/build/public/"
    ServerName {%= name %}.dev
    <Directory /path/to/{%= name %}/build/public/>
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

```

### MySQL

To avoid any extra configuration, create a database called `{%= name %}` and a user called
`{%= name %}` with password `{%= name %}` with `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER`
permissions on the `{%= name %}` database, with access from localhost.

If you must use a different configuration, then create a file `build/app/config/local/database.php` using the one in
`build/app/config/database.php` as a template (you only need to include settings that differ from those in
`build/app/config/database.php` - Laravel config settings are inherited). Note that an existing .gitignore file will
prevent your local configuration being checked in to git.

If your machine's `hostname` ends in `.local` then the `--env=local` part above is optional. Unfortunately Laravel 4
defaults to `production` if it can't match your hostname against the patterns in `build/bootstrap/start.php` so it
would be good to get into the habit of using `--env` all the time, just in case.

### Bootstrap your database

```bash
cd build/
php artisan migrate --env=local --seed
```

### Test

Visit [http://{%= name %}.dev/](http://{%= name %}.dev/) and you should see the home page. Check your browser's error console
for any load errors or javascript errors.

Building
--------

In development, run the following command to have the grunt watcher build your sass and js as you work:

    cd build/
    grunt dev

Prior to checkin or release, run a full grunt build to ensure the linter is happy with your code and all tests pass:

    cd build/
    grunt
