MonkeyBones
===========

### The bones of a productive Laravel web project

[MonkeyBones][10] is a [grunt-init][1] template developed and used by
[The Monkeys][2] when it's time to set up a new [Laravel][7] project.

*NOTE: From now on, when we say "MonkeyBones", we mean "grunt-init, using the [MonkeyBones][10]
template".*

MonkeyBones automates the setup of tools and packages we like to use. Projects created with [MonkeyBones][10] have an
"init.sh" script that makes it easier for new developers to get up to speed quickly.

There are some tools and packages we always use and [MonkeyBones][10] will include them in every new project:

* [HTML5Boilerplate][3]
* [Compass][5]
* [Grunt][8]

Others are optional:

* [BackboneJS][11]
* [Laravel][7]
* [MonkeyTestJS][19]

As you can might infer, [MonkeyBones][10] is particularly geared towards [Laravel][7] sites using [HTML5Boilerplate][3]
as the starting point for the front end. We've put a lot of work into splitting up the boilerplate CSS across the
[Compass][5] files and the HTML markup across the [Laravel][7] views.

[MonkeyBones][10] will ask you questions about the tools you want and will generate a project scaffold based on
your answers. 

Once the project is set up and checked into git, another developer can clone it and run the "init.sh" script to
configure their environment and install the tools they need for the project.


Getting MonkeyBones
-------------------

You install [MonkeyBones][10] once on your development machine and thereafter you can use it to start new projects.

#### Step 1: Make sure you have what you need to run [MonkeyBones][10]

[MonkeyBones][10] uses [grunt][1], which uses [node][13] and the node package manager [npm][14].

If you don't already have them installed, find the instructions for your platform and install them in this order:

1. [NodeJS][13] - npm is bundled with NodeJS
2. [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)


#### Step 2: Clone the [MonkeyBones][10] repo from [GitHub][25]

To make the project template available for use via [grunt-init][1], you need to install it into your
~/.grunt-init/ directory (%USERPROFILE%\.grunt-init\ on Windows).

The simplest approach is to use git to clone the template into that directory, ie:

  ```
  git clone git@github.com:TheMonkeys/monkeybones.git ~/.grunt-init/monkeybones
  ```

#### Step 3: There isn't really a step 3

That's it, [MonkeyBones][10] is all set up. To make sure, have a look in your .grunt-init directory:

```
ls ~/.grunt-init/
```

You should see a directory called "monkeybones". There's a bunch of stuff in there which you can look at
one day when you have to look busy. For now, just rest assured that the installation has gone according to plan.




Setting up a new Laravel web project with MonkeyBones
-----------------------------------------------------

#### Step 1: Make a new directory for your project

[MonkeyBones][10] will generate the files in the current directory, so be sure to make a new directory and then cd into it.

  ```
  mkdir MyProject
  cd /path/to/MyProject
  ```

#### Step 2: Run [grunt-init][1], specifying "monkeybones" as the project template

  ```
  grunt-init monkeybones
  ```

You'll see some standard [grunt-init][1] messages, eg:

```
Running "init:monkeybones" (init) task
This task will create one or more files in the current directory, based on the
environment and the answers to a few questions. Note that answering "?" to any
question will show question-specific help and answering "none" to most questions
will leave its value blank.
```

Note that if there are any existing files in the current directory, grunt-init will fail and you will see this message:

```
Warning: Existing files may be overwritten! Use â€“force to continue.
```

If that happens, start again from Step 1.

If all is going according to plan, you'll see another message:

```
"monkeybones" template notes:
A web project template with a ready-made Gruntfile to give you javascript
minification, Sass compilation, unit testing and more, as well as optional
Laravel 4.0, backbone.js and/or acceptance testing framework.
```
And a message to let you know that npm is about to scour the internetz for the packages [MonkeyBones][10] needs:

```
Using npm install to get template script dependencies.
```

Following that there'll be a long list of packages, like:

```
npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/unzip/0.1.6
npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/request/2.16.6
npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/chmodr/0.1.0
npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/pipette/0.9.3
```
etc.

[MonkeyBones][10] will then start asking you questions and waiting for answers before continuing:

```
Please answer the following:
[?] Project name (MyProject)
```

[MonkeyBones][10] takes guesses and provides you with default answers. Pressing return without answering a
question will automatically choose the default option. If you don't like the default, type in another
answer and press return.

Most of the questions should be pretty self explanatory. One thing that's worth noting is that
[MonkeyBones][10] assumes that you're using git (and suggests a repo name):

```
[?] Project git repository (git://github.com/presentation/MyProject.git) 
```

You should probably make sure that the repo you specify exists when you get to that point.

When you get to this one, if you don't have a strong opinion about that then the correct answer is
probably yes (which is the default):

```
[?] Do you want me to automatically download dependencies and build after setting up your project? (Y/n)
```
If you answer "Y", [MonkeyBones][10] will run the "init.sh" script automatically after the project is set up.
This script checks that you have all the system dependencies that are required to run the tools that
[MonkeyBones][10] has just downloaded. If you choose not to run init.sh automatically, you should run it manually
when MonkeyBones setup is complete. That's covered in the next section, "Working on a MonkeyBones project"

Once you're done with all the questions, [MonkeyBones][10] will start setting up your new project based on the
answers you gave. It will go off into the internetz and get the packages you need, install them and maybe
do a bit of jiggery and pokery to integrate into your project. You'll get progress updates, eg:

```
Writing .gitattributes...OK
Writing .gitignore...OK
Writing README.md...OK
```

And so on.

#### Step 3: Tidying up

There are probably a few things that you'll want to tweak before you and others start working on your new project.

At the very least, you'll check the new project into Git, eg:

```
git init
git remote add origin git://github.com/presentation/MyProject.git
```


Working on a MonkeyBones project
--------------------------------

There are two ways that you might come into posession of a project that has been set up with [MonkeyBones][10] -
either you set it up or you cloned a git repo. Either way, once you have it, working on it is the same.

Your project will obviously need to be served up using whatever webserver you usually use in your
local dev environment so you'll need to know which folder to set as your webroot. You might also
be new to some of the tools (like [Grunt][6]), so it's worth clarifying what's what.

If you open the project directory in your IDE, you'll see different folders and files depending
on the tools you opted for. A basic front end project might look something like the image below
if you're using [Sublime][24].



![MonkeyBones](http://monkeybones.io/img/mb_screen-shot-1.png)



As you can see, on the top level there are three directories: "build", "prototype" and "deployment".
We use "prototype" for any early prototypes of the project so that they're in the same repo as the
project. The "deployment" directory is used for our deployment script, part of our CI process.
You can ignore both folders if you like - or delete them.

The "build" folder is where your project files live:



![MonkeyBones](http://monkeybones.io/img/mb_screen-shot-2.png)



Basically, you work in the "/build/web" directory and [Grunt][6] compiles everything into the "/build/public" directory.

So your webroot is the "/build/public" directory.

Run init.sh to make sure that you have everything you need installed on your machine.

```
bash ./init.sh
```

Don't be scared, you can run init.sh as many times as you like and nothing bad will happen. Once you're over the
initial hurdles, you'll run init.sh any time you need to get a project up to date with the packages
it needs.

At the very least (for a purely front end project) init.sh will check that you have:

```
Checking for executable npm...OK
Checking for executable grunt...OK
Checking for executable compass...OK
Checking for executable composer...OK
```

If you're using [Laravel][7], init.sh will check for [PHP][16] and also for [MySQL][17]

```
Checking for executable php...OK
Checking for executable mysql...OK
```

If you don't have what you need, init.sh will let you know and stop there. You'll have to Google the tool you
need and follow the installation instructions for your platform. When you run init.sh again it should get past
that point.

Then [Node][13] packages:

```
Installing npm dependencies...
```

If you're using PHP, init.sh also checks for any [Composer][18] packages that are required for the project:

```
Installing composer dependencies...
```

You may get a few warnings along the way, but if you see this message at the end, you're probably right to go:

```
Done, without errors.
```

If you don't see that, look back over the output and correct any issues before running init.sh again. If you haven't used
[MonkeyBones][10] before, you probably won't get through it in one go becuase of the dependencies, so just keep at it.


#### Background

There has been a seizemic shift happening in front end web development over the last
few years. In a nutshell, ["weâ€™re seeing the emphasis shift from valuing trivia to valuing
tools"][9].

The tools we're talking about are everything from boilerplates like [h5bp][3] to
frameworks like [SASS][21] and [Backbone.js][11] to build tools like [Compass][5] and [Grunt][6]
to tesing frameworks like [Mocha][12] and [MonkeyTestJS][19].

The problem is that using these tools takes work and time. They come with a learning
curve and they're updated regularly. We have to spend time learning how to use them,
keeping them up to date, managing dependencies and finding out about new tools that
come online.

That's fine if you're working on a few projects a year, but we do dozens of
projects every year and some of them are very small. The temptation is to not
use all the tools for small jobs especially with new developers. For a three
day front end build, is it really feasible for a new developer to spend the
time getting up and running with a suite of unfamiliar tools? Unfortunately
for the developers who have to maintain or extend that project later, it usually
isn't. But with [MonkeyBones][10], it is.


#### Roadmap

Some things have changed in the world since we started developing [MonkeyBones][10]. [Yeoman][20], a high profile
workflow tool for web apps by some high profile peoople, has relaunched as a collection of tools including [Yo][22],
a scaffolding tool similar to [grunt-init][1]. In fact, so similar that [it will we be completely replacing [grunt-init][1]
at some point](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init/issues/31). Before that happens, we'll be porting [MonkeyBones][10]
over to [Yeoman][20] as a [generator](http://yeoman.io/community-generators.html).

The name "MonkeyBones" will basically be a namespace. The current project template, geared as it is towards [Laravel][7]
and [HTML5Boilerplate][3], will probably become a [Yeoman][20] generator called something like "monkeybones-laravel-html5bp". We'll
make other generators for different technology stacks - for example, "monkeybones-express-html5bp" for the [NodeJS][13]
framework [Express][23].
