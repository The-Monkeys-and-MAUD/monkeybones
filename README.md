Monkeybones
===========
## The bones of a productive web project

Monkeybones is a [grunt-init](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init) project template developed and used by
[The Monkeys][1] that brings together the best of our ideas about web development done well.

Based on your answers to a few questions about your project, Monkeybones will generate a project scaffold for you
complete with the mod cons we think are essential to doing the best possible work. Those include h5bp, Modernizr,
Compass, Grunt, Laravel 4.0 and an acceptance testing framework built on qunit.

Usage
