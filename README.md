Monkeybones
===========
## The bones of a productive web project

Monkeybones is a [grunt-init][1] project template developed and used by [The Monkeys][2] that brings together the best
of our ideas about web development done well.

Based on your answers to a few questions about your project, Monkeybones will generate a project scaffold for you
complete with the mod cons we think are essential to doing the best possible work. Those include [h5bp][3],
[Modernizr][4], [Compass][5], [Grunt][6], [Laravel 4.0][7] and an acceptance testing framework built on [qunit][8].
